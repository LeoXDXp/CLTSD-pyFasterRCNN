# CLTSD-pyFasterRCNN
Chilean Traffic Sign Dataset (In Development) with python's implementation of Faster RCNN

This is a fork from https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn

The Notes.md contains some technical insights developed during this proyect.

The Dataset unfortunately is no longer available. I'll try to re-upload it in the future
